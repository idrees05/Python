### Hi üëã, I'm Idrees Rahman
I'm Idrees from the UK. I really enjoy learning and applying coding languages like Python, JavaScript and C#. I also worked in Wix. 
Recently I've been enjoying the use of Chat GPT and testing its boundaries on its capability to code and even teach me code. 
I come from a family of IT enthusiasts, with two close uncles as software developers and one Sys admin. This has given me invaluable instinct and experience with tech.

Also some extremely conflicting advice on what coding languages to learnüòÅ.

I have decided to just stick with Python for now, master it and do a few projects. 
And in time I hope to be able to buld an awsome GitHub profile with a ton of projects.

p.s I've also been looking for an apprenticeship as a software developer. Really hard but will not give up
